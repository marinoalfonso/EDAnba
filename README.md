# NBA Player Performance Analysis

Welcome to the repository for NBA player performance analysis from 1950 to 2021!

## Project Description
Through an exploratory analysis of historical NBA data, this project aims to examine the evolution of the game over the years, identifying trends, iconic players and significant changes in the way basketball has been played and enjoyed.

## Analysis Notes
The analysis has been divided by decade to examine trends and changes in the game over time. Tools such as R, and data analysis libraries (e.g. tidyverse and ggplot2) have been used to perform statistical analysis and create clear and informative visualizations.

## About Dataset

The N.B.A. introduced the 3-point shot in the 1979-80 season. So, 3PA, 3P, and 3P% are absent in older records.
